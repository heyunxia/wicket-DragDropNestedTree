# wicket-DragDropNestedTree 
Drag, drop, add, delete, re-order child components of a recursive object


# Welcome to the wicket-DragDropNestedTree wiki!


You can simply extend the `DynamicDragDropNestedTree `and get your panel working. 

This tree is useful for records which recursively contain a list of sub records of the same type. 

You can drag-drop the items in the list to change their parents.
